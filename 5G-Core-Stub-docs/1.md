## 5G Core Stub

1. NGAP (Next Generation Application Protocol) for signaling between gNodeB and AMF.
2. PFCP (Packet Forwarding Control Protocol) for signaling between SMF and UPF.
3. NAS (Non-Access Stratum) for signaling between UE and core network through gNodeB.
4. HTTP/2 for signaling between core network functions (e.g., between AMF and SMF).
5. SCTP for transport of NGAP messages.
6. GTP-U for user plane data transfer.

### Outline
1. **Core Network Functions:**
    - AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function)
    - SMF (Session Management Function)
    - UPF (User Plane Function)
    - AUSF (Authentication Server Function)
    - UDM (Unified Data Management)

2. **RAN Components:**
    - gNodeB (Next Generation Node B)

3. **Relevant Protocols:**
    - NGAP (Next Generation Application Protocol)
    - PFCP (Packet Forwarding Control Protocol)
    - NAS (Non-Access Stratum)

### Libraries and Tools
- `scapy` for packet manipulation.
- `asyncio` for asynchronous operations.
- `socket` for networking.
- pygtp for GTP-U (GPRS Tunneling Protocol User Plane) implementation.
- pysctp for SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) implementation.
