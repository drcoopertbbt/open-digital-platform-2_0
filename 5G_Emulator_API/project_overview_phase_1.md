5G simulator is now running smoothly without any deprecation warnings. All components are starting up correctly and registering with the NRF. Here's a quick summary of what's been achieved:

- All FastAPI components (NRF, AMF, SMF, UPF, AUSF, UDM, UDR, UDSF, CU, DU) are now using the new lifespan context manager.
- Each component is successfully registering with the NRF upon startup.
- The AMF is correctly discovering the SMF through the NRF.
- The RRU and PTP components are running and providing output.

With the simulator up and running, it's time to explore 5G networks. Next steps:

1. **Test inter-component communication**:
   - Create a test script simulating a UE connecting to the network and going through the registration process. This will help understand how different components interact in a 5G network.
2. **Implement more 5G procedures**:
   - Add more functionality to each component to simulate various 5G procedures like handover, slice selection, or QoS management.
3. **Add monitoring and logging**:
   - Implement more detailed logging in each component to understand the message flow and internal processes of each network function.
4. **Simulate network scenarios**:
   - Create scripts to simulate different network scenarios, such as congestion, node failure, or varying signal strengths.
5. **Implement a basic UE simulator**:
   - Create a UE simulator that can interact with the gNodeB and core network components.
6. **Study 3GPP specifications**:
   - As more features are implemented, refer to the 3GPP specifications to ensure the simulator accurately reflects real 5G network behavior.
7. **Visualize network topology and message flow**:
   - Consider creating a simple web interface or using a visualization tool to display the network topology and message flow between components.

This simulator is a great learning tool, but it's a simplified version of a real 5G network.
