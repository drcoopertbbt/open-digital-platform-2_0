Imagine a sophisticated, user-friendly web interface designed with PatternFly UI components, providing comprehensive insights and control over your 5G SA network emulator. This interface could seamlessly blend real-time data visualization, interactive controls, and detailed monitoring capabilities.

For the 5G Core, the dashboard could feature visual representations of the key network functions: AMF, SMF, UPF, AUSF, UDM, UDR, UDSF, NEF, NSSF, and NWDAF. Each of these functions would have dedicated panels displaying health status, performance metrics, and recent activity, making it easy to monitor the overall state of the network at a glance.

Jaeger traces would offer deep insights into the flow of network traffic and interactions between these network functions. For instance, a trace could show the path of an authentication request from a UE, detailing how the request is processed by the AUSF, authenticated against the UDM, and subsequently communicated to the AMF. Another trace could illustrate session establishment, tracking messages between the UE, AMF, SMF, and UPF.

Loki logs would capture detailed event data from each network function. For example, logs from the AMF might include registration attempts, successful registrations, and handovers. SMF logs could show session creation, modification, and termination events. UPF logs could capture data forwarding activities and QoS enforcement. These logs would provide granular visibility into the operations of each component, enabling effective troubleshooting and performance analysis.

Prometheus metrics would offer real-time monitoring of various performance indicators. For the AMF, metrics could include the number of active UEs, registration success rate, and handover rate. SMF metrics might track session establishment time, active sessions, and session drops. UPF metrics could cover data throughput, packet loss, and latency. AUSF could provide metrics on authentication success rates and latencies. NEF metrics might include API request counts and response times.

The web interface could utilize PatternFly's data visualization components to present these metrics in a clear and interactive manner. Line charts could show trends over time, bar charts could compare different metrics, and tables could list detailed log entries. Interactive elements like forms and buttons could enable users to perform actions such as initiating traffic simulations, adjusting network configurations, and viewing historical data.

For the MEC hosts, the dashboard could feature panels showing the status of each MEC application, along with location service data and other application-specific metrics. Users could interact with the MEC applications, trigger location queries, and view the responses in real-time.

In essence, the PatternFly-based web interface would transform the complex 5G SA network emulator into an intuitive and powerful tool, providing deep visibility, control, and analysis capabilities, all wrapped in a polished and professional design. This would enable users to not only monitor the network but also actively manage and optimize it, leveraging the rich data collected by Jaeger, Loki, and Prometheus.
