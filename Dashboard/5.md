### Detailed User Flow

#### A: User lands on homepage
As the user opens the application, they are greeted by a clean and intuitive homepage. The homepage features a prominent navigation bar at the top, providing quick links to different sections of the application, including the 5G SA network emulator. The page is designed with a consistent color scheme and professional layout, setting a positive tone for the user's experience.

#### B: User navigates to the 5G SA network emulator
The user clicks on the link to the 5G SA network emulator in the top navigation bar. This action takes them to the main dashboard of the emulator. The transition is smooth, and the dashboard loads quickly, maintaining the same consistent design language seen on the homepage.

#### C: User interacts with the PatternFly components on the main dashboard
The main dashboard is a dynamic and interactive space filled with PatternFly components. The user sees multiple cards, each representing a different network function (e.g., NEF, NSSF, NWDAF). Each card includes a combination of charts, badges, and tables, providing a high-level overview of the health status, performance metrics, and recent activities of each network function.

- **Visual Details**: The cards are visually appealing, with clear headers, vibrant charts, and color-coded badges indicating status (e.g., green for operational, red for issues). The tables list the most recent logs, showing timestamps and brief descriptions of each event.

#### D: User drills down into detailed views using expandable sections and modals
The user clicks on a card, for instance, the NEF card. This action expands the card into a detailed view, revealing additional sections for various metrics like CPU usage, memory utilization, and network traffic. Each section can be expanded or collapsed to manage the information displayed.

- **Visual Details**: The expandable sections have smooth animations, and the detailed metrics are presented in clear, interactive charts. If the user clicks on a specific metric, a modal pops up, providing deeper insights with real-time logs, traces, and configurable options.

#### E: User configures network parameters using PatternFly forms and buttons
Within the detailed view, the user finds a form to configure network parameters. They can input new values, select options from dropdowns, and toggle switches to adjust settings. Below the form, there are action buttons like "Save Configuration" and "Reset to Default."

- **Visual Details**: The form fields are well-spaced and clearly labeled, ensuring easy readability. The action buttons are prominent and intuitively placed at the bottom of the form, guiding the user through the process.

#### F: User monitors real-time network data using PatternFly charts and visualizations
The user returns to the main dashboard, where they can monitor real-time network data. Various PatternFly charts (line, bar, pie, heatmap) dynamically update to reflect the latest network performance metrics. 

- **Visual Details**: The real-time data visualization is smooth and responsive. Line charts display trends over time, bar charts compare different network slices, pie charts show resource allocation, and heatmaps indicate traffic density. The live updates provide an engaging and informative experience.

#### G: User receives alerts and notifications using PatternFly alerts and toasts
As the user interacts with the dashboard, they receive alerts and notifications. Critical issues trigger alerts that appear prominently at the top of the dashboard, while less urgent updates generate toasts that briefly appear at the bottom of the screen.

- **Visual Details**: Alerts are color-coded (e.g., red for critical, yellow for warnings) and include clear messages with actionable buttons like "View Details" or "Dismiss." Toasts are unobtrusive but informative, sliding in and out smoothly, keeping the user informed without interrupting their workflow.

#### H: User explores data using PatternFly filters, sort controls, and data toolbar
The user decides to explore specific data sets. They use a data toolbar at the top of the detailed views, featuring filters for time range, network function, and metric type, as well as sort controls for organizing the data.

- **Visual Details**: The toolbar is user-friendly, with dropdown filters and sort options that are easy to interact with. Users can quickly adjust the view to focus on the most relevant data, enhancing their ability to analyze and understand network performance.

#### I: User integrates observability tools using PatternFly tabs
To get a comprehensive view, the user switches between different observability tools integrated into the interface using PatternFly tabs. These tabs include sections for Metrics (Prometheus), Traces (Jaeger), and Logs (Loki).

- **Visual Details**: The tabs are clearly labeled and easy to switch between. Each tab provides a tailored view with specific charts, tables, and visualizations relevant to the selected observability tool, ensuring a cohesive and integrated user experience.

#### J: User monitors the network in real-time using PatternFly live update panels
In addition to the static charts and tables, the user engages with live update panels that provide real-time monitoring of network performance. These panels update automatically to reflect the latest data from Prometheus.

- **Visual Details**: The live update panels display metrics like latency, throughput, and error rates, with smooth transitions and real-time data refreshes. Gauges and line charts are used to show current values and trends, making it easy for users to stay on top of the network's status.

#### K: User experiences a consistent and visually appealing interface using PatternFly global theme settings
Throughout their interaction, the user appreciates the consistent and visually appealing interface provided by PatternFly's global theme settings. The design is cohesive, with uniform color schemes, typography, and UI patterns that create a professional and intuitive experience.

- **Visual Details**: The consistent design elements enhance usability, with every component from buttons to charts following the same visual language. This uniformity reduces cognitive load and makes the application more intuitive and pleasant to use.

### Summary
This user flow illustrates how the combination of PatternFly components and thoughtful design principles can create a powerful, user-friendly interface for a 5G SA network emulator. The user can efficiently navigate, configure, and monitor the network through a series of well-integrated, visually consistent interactions that enhance their overall experience and productivity.
