## Front-end

- Grafana: A Grafana dashboard can be set up to visualize metrics, logs, and traces from Loki and Jaeger. This will provide a centralized web interface to monitor and analyze the system's performance.

- Custom Web UI: Optionally, a custom web frontend can be developed using React for visualizations and controls for the 5G emulator.



## OpenTelemetry - 3 signals

- Integrate OpenTelemetry SDK in all NFs to collect metrics, logs, and traces

### Logs
Loki: For log aggregation and querying, we can use Grafana Loki. Logs from all network functions (NFs) will be sent to Loki for centralized logging. Grafana will be used to visualize and query these logs.

### Tracing - NFs
Jaeger: For distributed tracing, we can use Jaeger to trace requests across the different NFs. This will help visualize the flow of requests and identify latency and bottlenecks.

### Metrics


## Other:

### Traffic Capture and Analysis

- Wireshark: For detailed network traffic analysis, I'll use Wireshark to capture packets. 
- Hooks can be added to capture traffic between NFs for offline analysis.
