Excellent! Your AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function) is now correctly recording metrics for the requests you've made. Let's analyze the results:

1. AMF Requests Total:
   ```
   amf_requests_total 4.0
   ```
   This shows that your AMF has received and processed 4 requests, which matches the number of times you called the `/amf_service` endpoint.

2. AMF Request Latency:
   ```
   amf_request_latency_seconds_count 4.0
   amf_request_latency_seconds_sum 2.9489998269127682e-05
   ```
   This indicates that:
   - 4 requests were measured for latency (matching the total requests).
   - The total time taken for all requests was about 29.5 microseconds.
   - The average latency per request is approximately 7.37 microseconds (29.5 / 4), which is very fast.

3. Latency Distribution:
   All requests were completed in less than 5 milliseconds, as all buckets up to 0.005 seconds (5 ms) have a count of 4.

4. Other Metrics:
   - The Python garbage collection and process metrics are also being recorded, which can be useful for monitoring the overall health of your AMF process.

These metrics demonstrate that your AMF is functioning correctly and responding quickly to requests. Here are some next steps and considerations:

1. Set up Prometheus to scrape these metrics regularly. Ensure your Prometheus configuration includes a job for the AMF pointing to `localhost:9100`.

2. Create Grafana dashboards to visualize these metrics over time. This will help you monitor:
   - Request rate (requests per second)
   - Average latency
   - Latency distribution (using the histogram buckets)

3. Consider adding more specific metrics to your AMF, such as:
   - Counters for different types of AMF operations (e.g., registrations, authentications)
   - Gauges for current number of connected UEs
   - Error counters

4. Implement similar metrics for your other Network Functions (SMF, UPF, etc.) to get a comprehensive view of your 5G core network emulator.

5. Set up alerting rules in Prometheus for important thresholds, such as high latency or error rates.

6. As you develop your 5G core network emulator further, continue to refine and expand your metrics to capture important aspects of its performance and behavior.

Your AMF is now successfully instrumented with Prometheus metrics, providing valuable insights into its operation. This is a great foundation for monitoring and optimizing your 5G core network emulator.
